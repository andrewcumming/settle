This code computes ignition conditions for Type I X-ray bursts using a multi-zone model of the accreting layer (including hot CNO hydrogen burning, but not helium burning), but a one-zone ignition criterion. For more details, see [Cumming & Bildsten (2000)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...544..453C).
